<h3>Bio</h3>						

<p>Tom Fels is independent curator and writer specializing in American culture, photography, and art, and he is an increasingly successful artist himself.</p> 

<p>Tom has worked as consultant and guest curator for institutions including the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute and the J. Paul Getty Museum. In 1986 he was named a Chester Dale Fellow of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and in 1998 a Fletcher Jones Foundation Fellow of the Huntington Library.</p> 

<p>Among more than fifty exhibitions he has organized are showcases for Eadweard Muybridge and A. J. Russell. The Getty presented "Carleton Watkins: Western Landscape and the Classical Vision" (1990), and the van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam "Fire and Ice: Treasures from the Photograph Collection of Frederic Church at Olana" (2002). (The companion volume was nominated for the Alfred H. Barr, Jr. Award of the College Art Association, the Philip Johnson Award of Society of Architectural Historians, and the Wittenborn Memorial Book Award of the Art Library Society of North America.)

<p>Tom is the author of numerous other catalogs and articles. <i>O Say Can You See: American Photographs 1839-1939</i> was published by MIT Press in 1989, and <i>Watkins to Weston: 101 Years of California Photography, 1849-1950</i> by the Santa Barbara Museum of Art in 1992. Mr. Fels has also written regularly for the <i>Print Collectors Newsletter</i> and <i>On Paper</i> magazine. </p>

<p>He has given public lectures at the Boston Athenaeum, the Addison Gallery, in Andover, Massachusetts, the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p> 

<p>Tom has also written two widely acclaimed books on the 1960s, <i>Farm Friends: From the Late Sixties to the West Seventies</i> (2008) and <i>Buying the Farm: Peace and War on a Sixties Commune</i> (2012).</p> 

<p>He began showing his recent art in the Northeast in 2013. His work has since appeared at Paris Photo, the Photography Show (AIPAD) in New York, and the Atlas Gallery in London, and has also been sold at Christie's. His art is represented in several museum and private collections, including the collection of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</p>
